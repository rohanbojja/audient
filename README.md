# Audient
Genre classification using machine learning and deep learning

## Getting started:
* Clone this repository.  
* Download GTZAN dataset and place it in the working directory to work with the dataset and build the model.  
* Install Anaconda and run the iPython notebook.  

## Requirements

* Keras
* Numpy
* Scipy
* Tensorflow

### TODO

* Improve model accuracy
* Train with keras.layers.GaussianNoise(stddev)?
* Try other models and variations.
* Normalize the training data for real life values. (Noise, frequency spectrum of the recording device, etc)

### Extension:

* Use super-genres for prediction. (https://musicmap.info/)
